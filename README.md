# Arrhythmia_CNN_Classifier
Final year project
bs
I trained the model using MIT-BIH dataset for arrhythmia. The model hutmod.h5 is used to classify different types of arrrhythmia, not only arrhythmia but also the signal is analyzed and a diverse analysis of different parts of signalis obtained. appo.py is used to load model in the backend and the index.html is the frontend part. A .hea and .dat file are uploaded in the frontend for processing and results are obtained almost instantly.
The project also entails transmitting data via MQTT and subscribing to it via node-red, and displaying info via node-red dashboard
